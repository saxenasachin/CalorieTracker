<h2>Clean Architecture and SOLID Principles</h2>

<p>This project follows Clean Architecture principles with a focus on SOLID principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clean Architecture Layers:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Domain:</strong> Contains business logic, use cases, and entities.</li>
      <li><strong>Data:</strong> Handles data sources, repositories, and external interactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> Manages UI using Jetpack Compose, separates UI logic from business logic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>SOLID Principles:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):</strong> Each class has a single responsibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Open-Closed Principle (OCP):</strong> Code is open for extension but closed for modification.</li>
      <li><strong>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):</strong> Objects are replaceable by instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.</li>
      <li><strong>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):</strong> Interfaces are specific to clients' needs, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.</li>
      <li><strong>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):</strong> High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
